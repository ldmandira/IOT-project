# Smart Door Concept

This project main aim is give more security for doors. We can simply use this system for any kind doors. 
Fingerprint acknowledgment and password are most secure systems because a fingerprint of one individual never coordinates with the others. Hence, unapproved access can be restricted by arranging a lock that stores the fingerprints of at least one approved individual and opens the lock when a match is found. Bio-measurements approval ends up being perhaps the best attribute because the skin on our palms and soles shows a stream like case of edges on each fingerprint which is uncommon and invariable. This makes fingerprint a novel ID for every individual. With this idea, a plan and a model of fingerprint-based entryway lock framework has been presented in this paper.
This system work on password concept too. 
If you have any finger problem or someone want to open the door, they can use password. There are several advantages of the biometric lock. Firstly, it is secure, unapproved individuals will not have any probability of accessing the framework. Besides, there is no requirement for a key.
